📒 Contact Book Application (Python)

This is a simple Contact Book application developed using Python. It is a menu-driven, command-line program that allows users to store and manage contact information efficiently.

The application supports basic contact management operations such as creating, viewing, updating, deleting, searching, and counting contacts. Each contact is stored using a dictionary, where the contact name acts as the key and the value contains details like age, email, and mobile number.

The program runs in a continuous loop, displaying a menu and accepting user input until the user chooses to exit. It helps beginners understand Python fundamentals, including dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

This project is ideal for Python beginners and students looking to practice core concepts and build a small real-world application using the command-line interface.

Technologies Used: Python
Concepts Covered: Dictionaries, CRUD operations, loops, conditionals, input/output
